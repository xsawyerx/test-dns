NAME
    Test::DNS - Test DNS queries and zone configuration

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
    This module helps you write tests for DNS queries. You could test your
    domain configuration in the world or on a specific DNS server, for
    example.

        use Test::DNS;
        use Test::More tests => 4;

        my $dns = Test::DNS->new();

        $dns->is_ptr( '1.2.3.4' => 'single.ptr.record.com' );
        $dns->is_ptr( '1.2.3.4' => [ 'one.ptr.record.com', 'two.ptr.record.com' ] );
        $dns->is_ns( 'google.com' => [ map { "ns$_.google.com" } 1 .. 4 ] );
        $dns->is_a( 'ns1.google.com' => '216.239.32.10' );

        ...

EXPORT
    This module is completely Object Oriented, nothing is exported.

ATTRIBUTES
  nameservers
    Same as in Net::DNS. Sets the nameservers, accepts an arrayref.

        $dns->nameservers( [ 'IP1', 'DOMAIN' ] );

  warnings
    Do you want to output warnings from the module, such as when a record
    doesn't a query result or incorrect types?

    This helps avoid common misconfigurations. You should probably keep it,
    but if it bugs you, you can stop it using:

        $dns->warnings(0);

    Default: 1 (on).

  follow_cname
    When fetching an A record of a domain, it may resolve to a CNAME instead
    of an A record. That would result in a false-negative of sorts, in which
    you say "well, yes, I meant the A record the CNAME record points to" but
    Test::DNS doesn't know that.

    If you want want Test::DNS to follow every CNAME till it reaches the
    actual A record and compare that A record, use this option.

        $dns->follow_cname(1);

    Default: 0 (off).

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  is_a
    Check the A record resolving of domain or subdomain.

        $dns->is_a( 'domain' => 'IP' );

        $dns->is_a( 'domain', [ 'IP1', 'IP2' ] );

  is_ns
    Check the NS record resolving of a domain or subdomain.

        $dns->is_ns( 'domain' => 'IP' );

        $dns->is_ns( 'domain', [ 'IP1', 'IP2' ] );

  is_ptr
    Check the PTR records of an IP.

        $dns->is_ptr( 'IP' => 'ptr.records.domain' );

        $dns->is_ptr( 'IP', [ 'first.ptr.domain', 'second.ptr.domain' ] );

  is_mx
    Check the MX records of a domain.

        $dns->is_mx( 'domain' => 'mailer.domain' );

        $dns->is_ptr( 'domain', [ 'mailer1.domain', 'mailer2.domain' ] );

  is_cname
    Check the CNAME records of a domain.

        $dns->is_cname( 'domain' => 'sub.domain' );

        $dns->is_cname( 'domain', [ 'sub1.domain', 'sub2.domain' ] );

  is_record
    The general function all the other is_* functions run.

        $dns->is_record( 'CNAME', 'domain', 'sub.domain', 'test_name' );
